# ASM stuff
**Stuff I made while learning assembly**

Compile in linux. You can use my small [`nasmo`](https://github.com/r4v10l1/arch-dotfiles/blob/main/dotfiles/bashrc/nasmo) script.

Just like in [`c-stuff`](https://github.com/r4v0l1/c-stuff) you will be able to see my progression. And that might include bad practises at first.
